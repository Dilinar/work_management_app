# The Work Management App

Link to project: https://dilinar.github.io/work_management_app/

This is one of the first projects I have created back in the day when learning vanilla JavaScript.
I've always liked it because it contains many useful tools in one. So I've decided to rewrite it in React, with the use of Redux and Material UI, all written in Typescript. 

The idea was to create a single app that combines various tools that could be useful in an office setting. 

The always visible right-hand panel contains a clock with date display. 
A timer that counts down from a given amount of hours, minutes and seconds. The input does not matter, that is if you input 200 minutes, it will convert it to 3 hours and 20 minutes and count down from that. 
And a stopwatch. In case you need to keep track of how long a task did take you.

The middle, or left part of the app (depending on the screen width, so let's call i the main part) is where you'll be using the always popular to-do list, which will most likely be the main tool. 
And when the work day is over, the main part can also be host to your very own workout routine. In the "Workout Calendar" you will find 7 windows (for each day of the week) to write down your workout routine. 
Working out after a day of sitting is what I like to do each day. So having easy and quick access to my weekly routine is important for me. 


# Extended bio

My name is Szymon, but You can call me Simon if You like. After having multiple jobs first in physical labor and later on a couple of office jobs, I've started my own business in March 2019, although it was a startup for a couple of months before that. I wanted to work for myself and be artistically active. So I've opened a shop with hand-dyed yarn known as Slavica Yarns. 

Somewhere down the road, I got annoyed by my current online shop provider, so I've decided to learn to program and create my own. I was already using basic HTML and CSS to style the various pages in my shop, so how hard could it be? I admit, I've bitten off more than I could chew, learning to be a full-stack developer in a year was madness. 

Even Though I was doomed to fail in creating my own online shop in a year, I've been bitten by the programming bug (pun intended ;P) and what was supposed to be a means to an end became my hobby of sorts. I was fascinated by what my mentor (a full-stack React developer) could do, how fast and easy it is for him to create all sorts of functionalities and logic. I know I have a long way to go, but that is what I would like to achieve. One day I would like to be able to sit down and write a whole web page or app from A to Z. I especially like writing logic, styling ain't much my thing, but figuring out the proper combination of functions, calling other functions, influencing multiple states at the same time to create the required result is my jam. Not that I'm much better at it than styling though. 

Hope You'll enjoy what You find in this repository. 

Have a nice day!
